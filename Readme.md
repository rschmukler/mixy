# Mixy

Proxy to mix compiler which will expand paths of umbrella projects. Ironically written in go.

## Install

```
go install github.com/rschmukler/mixy
```

## Why on Earth?

Mostly for editors. Specifically for getting errors in the gutter.

## Warning

This code is hacked together. Feel free to PR with a proper re-write ;)
